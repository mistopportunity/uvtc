Malice moves come from the fist. Fear comes from emotion.|In this world, you may find moves that can help you in your future battles.|Master your moves and their functions and you will begin to find certain synergies between them.|Number 2: Winning|To win a battle, you must bring your opponent's health all the way down.|If that happens to you, you will lose. What that means depends on the situation you are in.|There may sometimes be a way to bargain or bribe your way into winning, but that all depends on you and your opponent.|Number 3: Your turn|Once it is your turn, you select which type of move you are going to use. (Malice, fear, or logic)|Then, you will choose one of your moves that have in your slots.|Oh! You don't know about slots yet!|Here, I will teach you.|Wimpy Punch|I just gave you a malice move called Wimpy Punch! Now you can fight!|But first, you will need to slot your move.|If you are ready to battle, talk to Burr and you two can battle.|What!

I'M SCARED.|Okay he's, uh, not part of your lesson... moving on.|I believe the best way to teach is to dump a massive load of information on you all at once.|So, alright, HERE IT GOES.|Well, that was my speech about battling. If you want to hear it again, just ask.|malice|Okay Burr, you know how to fight, right?|Uhh, yeah. Totally dude.|Okay! Great.
